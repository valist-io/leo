# LEO (Low Ethereum Orbit)

> LEO is a [Ethereum Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) client built on libp2p.

LEO makes Ethereum state more accessible by distributing it on a peer-to-peer network. This enables access to the full Ethereum state without the need for a centralized RPC provider.
