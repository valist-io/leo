## Bridge Nodes

> Bridge nodes are responsible for injecting new pieces of state into the network. They do so by providing state from an existing Ethereum full-node.

Each time the blockchain head is updated, bridge nodes will provide the newly updated state to the network. They will also gossip the header to ensure the network has the most recent block.
